    Imbala is run by and for the members.
  </p>
  <p>
    Members make everything that happens at Imbala possible: from grocery shopping and cooking all
    our delicious food to planning parties, movie screenings, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    All decisions about the cooperative, including what's on the menu, how to respond to current
    events, and what the space looks like are made by consensus during monthly assemblies.
  </p>

  <p>
    We invite you to become a part of our dynamic community by becoming a member and joining us.
